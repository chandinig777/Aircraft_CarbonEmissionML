Carbon Emissions Prediction Using Machine Learning

 Overview
This project focuses on predicting carbon emissions from aircraft or transportation data using various machine learning regression techniques.
The aim is to build a robust model that can help stakeholders (airlines, logistics companies, or environmental analysts) estimate and reduce their 
carbon footprint based on operational parameters like fuel consumption, flight duration, and engine metrics.

 Dataset:
The dataset used is synthetic (or real, if you're using one), consisting of various flight-related features such as:

Flight_Duration

Fuel_Consumption

Distance

Altitude

Speed

Takeoff_Weight, Landing_Weight

Engine_Temperature, Cabin_Pressure, Wind_Speed, Turbulence_Index

Passenger_Count, Cargo_Weight

Target: Carbon_Emissions

Note: The data has been cleaned, preprocessed, and log-transformed (if applicable) for better modeling performance.
